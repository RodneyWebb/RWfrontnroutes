            <h3>"YOUth Unite is a GREAT digital platform for young people to share resources and make new connections. I joined at first to see if I could get help with applying for colleges to attend, and I was able to connect with a college student whose school is at the top of my list! I believe I found the Mentor that I've been looking for." -Sydney</h3>

            <h3>"I'm a Sophomore in high school and have been looking for a safe space digitally to meet new people that share similar interests as myself. Since joining YOUth Unite I have met some really cool people and we have a solid friend group! We plan on starting a weekly virtual book club, along with gaming sessions on weekends." -Cameron</h3>

            <h3>"I heard about YOUth Unite from a friend who encouraged me to join so I could ask someone for help with money management. I have been working for a few months now and am trying to make better financial decisions, so I started a conversation in the forum to see if I could get any money tips. I connected with another teen who's been working for over a year now and they shared their savings plan and budgeting tips with me. Now I feel more confident about my savings and spending plans!" -Amora</h3>
